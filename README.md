# Netflix-Website-Clone


This is a recreation of the Netflix landing page using HTML, CSS and JS. No code was taken from the official website. 
The pictures used were however taken from the Netflix website.

This is a project from my early days when I was exploring features in css and how to make pure html-css clones of websites ignoring the backend.
